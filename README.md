# white-balance

<p>
White balance (WB) is the process of removing unrealistic color casts, so that objects which appear white in person are rendered white in your photo. 
The white balance function of a digital camera ensures the objects in the image field are captured with colors in correlation to the light source. White light sources such as the sun are not always the same and can have different color temperatures (e.g., the sun, while the same light source varies depending on the time of day).
